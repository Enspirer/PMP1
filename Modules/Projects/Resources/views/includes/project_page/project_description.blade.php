<h2 class="title-about">About Project</h2>
<p>
    We're looking for an experienced wordpress developer to work
    with our team to deliver an excellent responsive website.The
    initial scope looks to be roughly 7 unique page templates + 2/3
    ancillary pages (T&C, Privacy, Cookies). We expect about 20
    unique UI components which will be re-used across those
    templates - Hero, Nav, Image Gallery etc. <br />
    <br />
    The number of integrations isn't currently known but we expect:
    * A contact form * An interactive component that will suggest
    products based on your preferred colours. * CMS obviously -
    ideally the majority of the page content will be editable
    through the CMS. <br />
    <br />
    The ideal candidate will: Be code quality focused, with an
    eagerness to provide the best experience for the user and the
    content editor. Work well against a deadline, working alongside
    our project team in a Scrum fashion with Epics, Stories and
    Sprints. Be comfortable working in a structure git centric
    process with feature based branches, pull requests and regular
    meaningful commits. <br />
    <br />
    A clean and clear continuous delivery process would be a great
    extra. We're open to guidance on the best frontend technology
    stack for this project, but particularly interested in
    suggestions around using wordpress as a headless CMS, with an
    11ty, gatsby, nextJS or other frontend. We're open to
    suggestions around the frontend technologies - SASS, SCSS,
    Timber, etc. The ideal proposal will include your preferred
    technology choices.
