        <p>
            We're looking for an experienced wordpress developer to work
            with our team to deliver an excellent responsive website.The
            initial scope looks to be roughly 7 unique page templates +
            2/3 ancillary pages (T&C, Privacy, Cookies). We expect about
            20 unique UI components which will be re-used across those
            templates - Hero, Nav, Image Gallery etc. <br />
            <br />
            The number of integrations isn't currently known but we
            expect: * A contact form * An interactive component that
            will suggest products based on your preferred colours. * CMS
            obviously - ideally the majority of the page content will be
            editable through the CMS. <br />
            <br />
            The ideal candidate will: Be code quality focused, with an
            eagerness to provide the best experience for the user and
            the content editor. Work well against a deadline, working
            alongside our project team in a Scrum fashion with Epics,
            Stories and Sprints. Be comfortable working in a structure
            git centric process with feature based branches, pull
            requests and regular meaningful commits. <br />
            <br />
            A clean and clear continuous delivery process would be a
            great extra. We're open to guidance on the best frontend
            technology stack for this project, but particularly
            interested in suggestions around using wordpress as a
            headless CMS, with an 11ty, gatsby, nextJS or other
            frontend. We're open to suggestions around the frontend
            technologies - SASS, SCSS, Timber, etc. The ideal proposal
            will include your preferred technology choices.
